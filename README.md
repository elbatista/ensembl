# Species Assembly Summaries Page (React)

A small React application that consumes the **Ensembl REST API** to display chromosome lengths for a selected species.

The app:
- Fetches available species from Ensembl
- Allows the user to select a species from a dropdown
- Displays chromosomes in **customary karyotype order**
- Shows chromosome lengths in **megabases (Mb)**
- Computes and displays the **total genome length**
- Works on desktop and mobile (responsive CSS)

## 🌐 Ensembl APIs used

This app consumes the following Ensembl REST endpoints:

- **Species list (only groups with 'variation')**
  ```
  https://rest.ensembl.org/info/species
  ```

- **Assembly information**
  ```
  https://rest.ensembl.org/info/assembly/{species}
  ```

Chromosomes are displayed ordered according to the `karyotype` field returned by the API.
